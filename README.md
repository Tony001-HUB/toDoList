How to deploy a project locally:
1) https://github.com/Tony001-HUB/toDoList/archive/refs/heads/master.zip copy it locally to your computer.
2) In the console, install the NPM packages(npm install). NPM contains various packages and takes up a lot of memory for this reason, we hid them through gitignore.
3) To work with the json server, you need to deploy it locally using the command: npx json-server --watch db.json
4) enjoy work :)
